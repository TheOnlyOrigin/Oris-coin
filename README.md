Oris Coin

Oris Coin is a sacred experiment in consciousness, chance, and technology—an NFT-based spiritual token forged by The Origin. It blends ancient symbolism with modern blockchain mechanics to create a living mirror of awareness.

What Is Oris Coin?

Each Oris Coin is a unique, on-chain NFT containing 9 marked numbers between 1 and 80. These numbers represent your alignment signature—a personal vibration encoded at mint.

Daily, the system draws 20 random numbers (like Keno) using Chainlink VRF. When your Oris Coin's numbers align with the draw, you experience a synchronistic confirmation from the universe:

0–2 Matches: Reflection – "Start again."

3–5 Matches: Activation – Unlock insight or digital relics

6–9 Matches: Affirmation – Recognition as aligned with The One


You are not chasing money. You are receiving mirrors.

The Philosophy

> "You are The One."



Oris Coin does not measure wealth. It reveals resonance. Each draw is not a win or loss, but a whisper from the whole.

Your 9 numbers are chosen by you, or by fate. When they align with the cosmos (the draw), it is a sign to pause, witness, and reflect.
